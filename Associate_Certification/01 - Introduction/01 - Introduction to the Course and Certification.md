# Notes

## Introduction

- Organisations can have security breaches due to any of, amongst other use cases:
    - Database credentials or access/secret keys being stored in notepad
    - Secrets handwritten on sticky notes
- This is obviously a huge potential security risk, as if secrets like this are compromised, servers, applications, and private data could all be exposed to attack.
- HashiCorp Vault aims to mitigate these risks by:
    - Manage secrets and protect sensitive data
    - Provide identity-based access management
    - Generate dynamic secrets e.g. database credentials, AWS secrets, etc.
- All the while remaining an open-source tool.

## Dynamic Secrets - High-Level View

- Consider a developer wanting to authenticate to a database for testing in a system where Vault has been implemented.

- Credential request is sent to Vault
- Vault immediately generates the credentials for the user
- This is hugely beneficial as it doesn’t depend on database admins generating the credentials.
- Additionally, Vault will monitor the timeframe of these credentials - if the Time-To-Live (TTL) for the credentials passes, Vault will automatically revoke these credentials - the user will then need to generate new credentials.
